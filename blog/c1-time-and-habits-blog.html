        <h3>SPRINT 1 - TIME AND HABITS</h2>
          <h5>27.FEB.2016</h5>

      <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
        <p>I tried the Pomodoro and Timebox technique’s.</p>
      <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
        <p>I felt most of the resources were useful in way or another. However one of favourites was the “Make it big by starting small” article. </p>
      <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
        <p>Toggl worked really well for me this week. I found looking at the report summary every night really helpful. It allowed me to easily assess how I had been using my time that day, and see if there were any patterns or habits growing.</p> 
      <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
        <p>I plan to experiment further with the Pomodoro technique and some of the "Making it big by starting small" concepts. My aim is to implement the 6 step process of Pomodoro technique with a time limit that works best for me.</p>
