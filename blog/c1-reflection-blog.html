          <h3>FIRE SIDE CHAT WITH SHEREEF</h3>
          <h4>26.FEB.2016</h4>
          <img title="Profile Pic" src="styles/profile.jpg" alt="Profile Pic"/>
          <h3>What's your take on the DBC <span>/</span> EDA experience?</h3>
            <p>
              I believe the EDA experience is what you make it or what you make of it. It requires you to understand the importance of team work, good people skills, develop the ability to adapt, learn and grow quickly while being able to accept failures and not knowing all the answers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two quotes come to mind at the moment, which are <em>“You reap is what you sow”</em> and <em>“What you put in, is what you get back.”</em>
            </p>
          <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
            <p>
              Because Shereefs video was so detailed, it helped me to better understand that this is your journey, take it with two hands, work hard and enjoy yourself. The support systems are all there but only you can reach out for help. Although the learning is going to be intense, I like to think that its going to be as intense as you make it.
            </p>
          <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
            <p>
              I see myself engaging well with the culture. One of the key reasons I decided to join EDA was the similarities of the guiding kaupapa/principles and values EDA have to those I have grown up with as part of the of the Whakatupuranga Rua Mano movement.
            </p>
          <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
            <p>
              No I don’t think my expectations have changed. Shereef’s video only emphasised what I already expected of EDA.
            </p> 
          <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
            <p>
              The past few weeks building up to this course were really exciting with the underlying feeling of nerves purely because of the sacrifices I’ve had to make. The nerves are still there but they’re also reminding me that what I’m doing is what I want to do and I don’t plan on wasting the opportunity.
