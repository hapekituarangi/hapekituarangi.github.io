      <h1>SPRINT 2: CULTURAL REFLECTION</h1>
      <h3>SEARCH INSIDE YOURSELF - CHAPTER ONE</h3>
      <h5>06.MAR.2016</h5>
      <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
      <p>Keeping a calm and clear mind is the foundation of mindfulness. It’s about living in the present and being at one with your wairua/spirit and emotions. From this you will be able to stay more emotional in tune with whats happening around you, with the environment and other people. It’s about staying in touch with your intuition or gut feeling and being able to feel and connect with other peoples wairua. To build on this, firstly you must look and feel at one within yourself before you can truly feel what is happening around you. How you are feeling inside has a natural way of rubbing off or touching other people without you sometimes even knowing it. If we can try and stay happy and positive more often then this will effect or be felt by those around you. There was a lot of other teachings in the first chapter but this is what I interpreted and feel I connected with the most.</p>
      <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
      <p>I thoroughly enjoyed the 2 minutes of mindfulness and found it quite easy to clear my mind and reflect on the key messages of the first chapter. I look forward to diving deeper into the “Search Inside Yourself” book and resources.</p>
